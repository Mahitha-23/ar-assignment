# AR Onboarding Proposal

This repository showcases my submission for the FLAM internship assignment, focused on enhancing the onboarding experience for Augmented Reality (AR) applications.

## Problem Statement

Many first-time users find AR interfaces overwhelming due to unfamiliar spatial interactions and lack of intuitive guidance. Conventional onboarding approaches—such as static tooltips or passive video tutorials—fail to engage users emotionally or adapt to their learning pace. This often leads to early drop-offs and underutilization of the app’s features.

## Proposed Solution

**Mirror World Onboarding** introduces a user-centered, interactive guide in the form of a personalized AR avatar. This avatar mirrors the user’s actions and guides them through core app features in a natural, human-like manner. The approach is designed to reduce cognitive load, build immediate user trust, and improve first-session engagement.
